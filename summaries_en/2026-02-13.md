## Today's Trends

Following lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) results, a major market trend has emerged characterized by falling long-term interest rates and a rebound in stock prices. At the same time, persistent market uncertainty remains due to heavy reliance on AI investment and the increasingly speculative nature of gold and silver markets. In the industrial sector, the acceleration of EV development by Honda and Nissan, coupled with policy shifts such as the potential repeal of U.S. emissions regulations, marks a critical turning point for global competition.
