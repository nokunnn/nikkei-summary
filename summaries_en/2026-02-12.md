While financial markets are showing heightened caution due to the significant drop in the Dow Jones and decline in Nikkei futures, the AI sector continues its fervor with developments like Anthropic's massive funding round. Additionally, Trump's moves regarding energy policy, diplomacy, and antitrust personnel appointments are becoming concrete, with clear implications for international order and the economy.
