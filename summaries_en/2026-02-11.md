The yen has strengthened to the 154 range against the dollar, marking a significant unwinding of previous yen-depreciation trades. Furthermore, massive investments in advanced technologies and their accompanying management risks are creating a divide between winners and losers, highlighted by Google's large-scale investment and Ford's significant EV-related losses.
